# InteractiveManhattan
This is a simple Shiny App, which can be used to interactively create and investigate a Manhattan Plot.

To run the Shiny App, you simply have to clone the repository and execute the contents of `app.R`.
Then you can upload a table with the data you want to visualize.

In the future, I plan to add a track which shows the genes in the specified genomic interval.

The basic functionalities can be seen in the showcase:
